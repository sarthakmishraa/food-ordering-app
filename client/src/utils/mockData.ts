          "That sounds delicious! Butter Chicken is a wonderful choice. It generally takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour to cook, not including marination time for the chicken.\n\nHere’s a recipe for you:\n\n**Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani)**\n\nThis recipe makes a rich, creamy, and mildly spicy curry.\n\n**Yields:** 4 servings\n**Prep time:** 20 minutes (plus 30 minutes to 2 hours marination)\n**Cook time:** 45-60 minutes\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**For the Chicken Marinade:**\n*   1 lb (about 450g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breast, cut into 1-inch pieces\n*   1/2 cup plain yogurt\n*   1 tbsp lemon juice\n*   1 tsp ginger-garlic paste (or 1/2 tsp grated ginger + 1/2 tsp minced garlic)\n*   1 tsp red chili powder (Kashmiri chili powder for color, if available)\n*   1/2 tsp turmeric powder\n*   1/2 tsp garam masala\n*   Salt to taste\n\n**For the Sauce:**\n*   2 tbsp unsalted butter\n*   1 tbsp oil (vegetable or canola)\n*   1 large onion, finely chopped\n*   1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste\n*   1 tsp red chili powder\n*   1 tsp garam masala\n*   1/2 tsp cumin powder\n*   1/2 tsp coriander powder\n*   1 can (14.5 oz / 400g) crushed tomatoes or 1.5 cups tomato puree\n*   1/2 cup water\n*   1/2 cup heavy cream (or cashew paste for dairy-free option)\n*   1 tbsp sugar (or to taste, balances the tanginess)\n*   1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi), crushed between your palms (optional, but highly recommended)\n*   Salt to taste\n*   Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**1. Marinate the Chicken:**\n    *   In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with all the marinade ingredients.\n    *   Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated.\n    *   Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for best flavor.\n\n**2. Cook the Chicken:**\n    *   Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat.\n    *   Once hot, add the marinated chicken pieces in a single layer, without overcrowding the pan. You may need to do this in batches.\n    *   Cook for 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is browned and mostly cooked through. It doesn't need to be fully cooked at this stage, as it will finish cooking in the sauce.\n    *   Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.\n\n**3. Prepare the Sauce:**\n    *   In the same pan, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat.\n    *   Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.\n    *   Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n    *   Add the red chili powder, garam masala, cumin powder, and coriander powder. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly, to toast the spices.\n    *   Pour in the crushed tomatoes or tomato puree. Add 1/2 cup of water, sugar, and salt to taste.\n    *   Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken. The oil should start to separate from the sauce.\n\n**4. Finish the Curry:**\n    *   Stir in the cooked chicken pieces into the sauce.\n    *   Pour in the heavy cream and the crushed kasoori methi (if using).\n    *   Simmer gently for another 5-10 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked through and tender, and the sauce is hot and creamy. Adjust seasoning if needed.\n\n**5. Serve:**\n    *   Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro.\n    *   Serve hot with basmati rice, naan bread, or roti.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade Butter Chicken! Let me know if you need any adjustments or have more cooking questions.",
